About
I am pursuing my B.tech in Computer Science and Engineering from BBDITM, Lucknow. 
Technology excites me and I am always in awe of the change it drives in the world. 
Certain skills that I have worked with include Data Structures and Algorithms (Java), Front End Web Development, and Python.
And what I might lack in skills I make up for with my determination to learn.
Outside of tech, I am a tea lover and love to play cricket and explore.
